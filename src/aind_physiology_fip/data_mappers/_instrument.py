class InstrumentMapper(AindDataSchemaMapper[Instrument]):
    """
    Maps raw instrument data to the AIND data schema Instrument format.

    This mapper class is responsible for transforming instrument
    configuration data from various sources (e.g., configuration files,
    hardware interfaces, or data acquisition systems) into the
    standardized AIND Instrument schema format.

    The class inherits from AindDataSchemaMapper and implements the
    generic mapping interface for Instrument objects. It provides a
    structured way to handle instrument metadata including hardware
    specifications, calibration information, and device configurations.

    Attributes:
        _mapped (Optional[Instrument]): The cached mapped Instrument
            object. This is None until the map() method is successfully
            called, after which it stores the resulting Instrument
            instance.

    Note:
        This is a template class with the map() method not yet fully
        implemented. Subclasses or future implementations should override
        the map() method to provide actual mapping logic specific to
        their instrument configurations.

    Example:
        >>> mapper = InstrumentMapper()
        >>> if not mapper.is_mapped():
        ...     instrument = mapper.map()  # Performs the mapping
        >>> mapped_instrument = mapper.mapped  # Retrieves the cache
    """

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Initialize the InstrumentMapper.

        Sets up the mapper with an empty mapped state. The actual mapping
        operation is performed when the map() method is called.

        Args:
            *args: Variable length argument list (currently unused,
                   reserved for future extensions or subclass
                   implementations).
            **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments (currently unused,
                      reserved for future configuration options or
                      subclass implementations).

        Note:
            The _mapped attribute is initialized to None, indicating that
            no mapping has been performed yet. This is checked by the
            is_mapped() method inherited from the base class.

        # This will be populated when map() is successfully called
